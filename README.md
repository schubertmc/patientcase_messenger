# Patient Case Messenger 

This project filters medical flashcards from your Anki deck and uses a Large Language Model to generate patient cases based on these cards. The cases are then sent to your phone via Telegram multiple times a day as patient alerts, helping you stay sharp and practice real-world clinical scenarios.

## Setup Instructions

	1.	Set your API keys in the .env file for OpenAI and Telegram.
